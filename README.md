<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>I completed this project in about 2 weeks I ran into alot of problems that required me to further my knowledge.Along the way I worked with React, a Js library which was verry stimulating for me to learn.I also added bootstrap 4, this came pretty straightforward to me this was more of going thru documentation to find how to style the way I want.</p>
